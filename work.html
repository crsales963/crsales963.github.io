              <h1>ALBUM PLAYER</h1>
              <p>A mock album player for an iPhone was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. With HTML and CSS,
              the structure and format of the albums were created as well as a song list for one of the albums.
              Then, with JavaScript, an album player was made in which the user can "pause/play" songs from one album,
              skip to the next/previous song, and control the volume. </p>

            <h1>GRAPHIC DESIGN PRINCIPLES</h1>
            <p>A webpage located at Virginia's DMV's site was evaluated based on the principles of graphic design.
            These principles are Simplicity, Contrast, Whitespace, Proximity, and Alignment. Based on the evaluation
            of specific facets that the page could do better or improve on, a redesigned version of the website,
            created on Figma, was created. </p>

            <p>As part of a capstone project to promote environmental organizations, I colloborated with Flipp, Inc.
            to help redesign their website. The purpose of this was twofold. First, it was to change the aesthetic of
            their current website. Second, it was to create more sections to provide the necessary information about
            what they do and how others can help.</p>

            <h1>POKEMON TEXT GAME</h1>
            <p>As a final project for CMSC 150: Introduction to Computing, I created a Pokemon Text Game using Object Oriented
            Programming in Python. The Pokemon game simulates the experience of capturing Pokemon, training them to grow stronger
            and evolve, and battling with them against gym leaders to obtaim badges.</p>
