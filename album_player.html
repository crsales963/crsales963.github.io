            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Utilizing HTML, CSS and JavaScript, this project mimics an &ldquo;album player&rdquo; similar to Spotify
            and iTunes. There are three webpages that make up this project: albums.html, songs.html and player.html.
            Aside from this, there is ipod.css which is the shared CSS file for the three HTML files and ipod.js
            which is the JavaScript file used to carry out the player functionalities in player.html.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;The first file, albums.html, simply contains 4 albums with their corresponding titles
            and artist/s. They are evenly spaced out on an iPhone outline. This was achieved by adjusting the styles
            of the albums, specifically their margins. Note: The iPhone outline has been cropped out of the images
            for aesthetic purposes.</p>
            <img src="images/album-player2.png" alt="" id="image_left_height">
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;The second file, songs.html, is a song list for the first album in albums.html, Code. songs.html
            can be accessed by clicking on either the name or text of the album in the albums.html. One could go back to the previous
            page by clicking the arrow icon on the top left corner. On top, it repeats information
            on the first page such as the picture of the album, title of album and artist/s with the addition of the year of the
            album. At the bottom, there is an ordered list of the songs contained in the album. If you hover over the songs, the text
            will change color and an underline will appear.</p>
            <img src="images/album-player3.png" alt="" id="image_right">
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Finally, the third file, player.html, &ldquo;plays&rdquo; the songs of the Code album. One can be brought to this
            page by selecting the first song of Code in songs.html, <em>Let's Go Up</em>. In here, the user can do 3 things. First, they can play
            the song. Upon entering the page, the song will be paused. The user can hit the play icon to &ldquo;plays&rdquo; the music. It will then
            change to a pause icon to indicate that the user can pause the song. It will also simulate the playback of the music, incrementing the time
            of the music played in each second. If the user hits the pause icon, the song will pause at its current time. Unfortunately, the time interval
            cannot be dragged or adjusted itself. However, one can proceed to the previous/next song in the album by hitting either of the buttons on
            the side of the play button. Hitting the button on the left will take the user to the previous song, and hitting the button on the right will
            take the user to the next song. The albums loops itself if it hits the beginning/end of the album. Aside from this, when the user hits either
            of these buttons, the playback will reset to the beginning of the song. Additionally, if the music is being &ldquo;played&rdquo;, the new song
            will start to play as well. If the music is paused, the new song is paused too. The last feature of this player is that the volume can be adjusted.
            By default, it is set in the middle, 3 bars out of 5. One can hit the plus button to increase the volume and the minus button to do the opposite.
            There are conditions in place that prevent the code from producing errors if the volume is being decreased when it's at its minimum and if it's
            being increased when it's at its maximum.</p>
            <p>You can check out the album player by clicking on the <a href="album_project/albums.html" target="_blank">link</a>. An embedded version of the
