            <h1>WHO AM I?</h1>
            <p>I was thirteen when I discovered my passion for STEM. Looking for a change of pace from the usual selection of activities, I curiously enrolled
              in a robotics and programming class in the summer of 2015. At the end of the course, I had built a robot car that I programmed to follow a visual
              path and avoid obstacles. Needless to say, I was completely fascinated, and I couldn’t wait to learn to do more. Despite the limited availability of STEM
              extracurricular programs in the Philippines at the time, I joined every course I could find, even traveling two hours one way just to attend classes. </p>
            <p>As the knowledge and skills I acquired from these courses began to blend into my school activities, I uncovered an equally strong penchant for teaching.
              What I initially started as private tutoring for a few friends rapidly led to the creation of EDUC8, my YouTube tutorial channel, which ended up catering to
              over 220 students in my graduating class. The online platform provided help in the areas of General Mathematics, Pre-Calculus, Chemistry, and Physics. Aside from this,
              I was appointed head of my school’s first robotics organization. It was in these sessions that I taught basic robotics and programming, encouraging other girls to
              explore the wonders of the field.</p>
            <p>Seven years later, my combined passions for STEM and teaching continue to lead me to seek new opportunities and greater challenges. Currently a junior
              at the University of Richmond, I am pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics, with a minor in Secondary Education. After college, I am
              looking to pursue a PhD in Computer Science, where I wish to be involved in research in Human Computer Interaction (HCI). My main interest lies in the intersection
              between technology and education, and I want to focus on optimizing technology to bridge existing gaps in learning.</p>
            <p>In the meantime, there is no shortage of endeavors that provide a steady stream of opportunities and challenges for me to better myself. One of these is
              my on-campus job at the Technology Learning Center. The work I do there, which began in my freshman year, allows me to develop proficiencies in the use of
              different software programs and applications. In turn, I use what I learn to address the technology needs of university students, faculty, and staff. There
              is also the work I do as a grader for Computer Science, which I’ve been involved in for three semesters. This has enabled me to develop skills in reading and
              debugging code while providing constructive feedback on students’ work. </p>
            <p>Meanwhile, off campus activities have been equally instrumental in leading me on a path of self-discovery. For one, working at Google in the summer of
              2022 was a major influence in my plans for the future. Surrounded by individuals, each with their unique and amazing academic and career journeys, inspired
              me to firm up my own educational goals and career plans beyond college. On the technical side, being a STEP intern has taught me valuable skills in programming,
              debugging, and unit testing, and I look forward to all the additional learning and skills I would gain when I return, this time as a SWE intern, for the following
              summer. </p>
            <p>Most recently, I also had the opportunity to take part in the Grace Hopper Conference in September 2022. I gained invaluable insight from other women in technology
              who have made remarkable achievements in their respective fields. The entire experience was a great source of empowerment and a strong motivation for me to strive
              to also one day make my own contribution and, hopefully, inspire other women to do the same.</p>
